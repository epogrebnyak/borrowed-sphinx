# Examples of [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) documentation

## Rules

Before starting make sure you understand:

- source: markdown, restructured text (rst)
- output: html, pdf
- code docstrings
- source (rst, markdown) -> theme -> config -> output (html, pdf)

Essence:

- `sphinx-build` reads source files in rst or markdown format and renders 
  html documentation from them using a provided theme and other configuration 
  parameters 
- sphinx adds own directives to rst that allow more control over
  documents structure and content
- sphinx can also produce documentation in latex that build to PDF

Themes:

- `read the docs` is a popular theme for sphinx, but there are many others.
  `pydata` is a modern documentation theme for sphinx.

Directives:

- `toctree` directive is central to sphinx - it builds document tree, so that 
   navigation works
- `autodoc` is another key directive that collects docstrings from code.
   This is how documentation is auto-generated. 

conf.py:

- `conf.py` is a python script that is used by sphinx-doc for configuration
- `conf.py` can be hand-written with just few lines or auto-generated, with tons
   of options that are hard to understand

## What may be difficult about sphinx

- sphinx consists of several sepearte command-line tools
- make scripts intended to help, but also obfuscate what and how work 
- configuration files autogenerated with `sphinx-quickstart` are a bit bloated
- there are also many directives besided `toctree` and `autodoc`  
- rst harder than markdown, even though more powerful
- there is a search engine under same name sphinx
- sphinx is difficult to rememder and type correctly

## Examples

`Examples` folder has four self-contained simple examples of sphinx-doc.
Change directory to example folder of interest and run:


```console
sphinx-build .  site
start site/index.html 
```

Folders:

1. `minimal`: conf.py + index.rst + rtd theme
2. `pages`: `toctree` directive, more pages and markdown parser
3. `pydata`: pydata theme and two toc levels
4. `autodoc`
